# 6. Why donâ€™t you use the const qualifier for function arguments that are one of the fundamental type

The const qualifier is typically used in function arguments to indicate that the function does not modify the value of the argument. When a fundamental type such as int, double, or char is passed by value to a function, it is already a copy of the original value, so there is no need to use the const qualifier to prevent modification of the original value.

However, it is still possible to use the const qualifier with fundamental types, for example:

```cpp
void printValue(const int value) {
    std::cout << "The value is: " << value << std::endl;
}
```

In this example, the const qualifier is used to indicate that the value argument will not be modified within the function. This can be useful for ensuring that a function does not accidentally modify the value of an argument.

In summary, while it is not necessary to use the const qualifier for fundamental types passed by value, it can still be used to indicate that the value will not be modified within the function.
