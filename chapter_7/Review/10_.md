# C++ enables you to pass a structure by value, and it lets you pass the address of a structure. If glitz is a structure variable, how would you pass it by value? How would you pass its address? What are the trade-offs of the two approaches?

To pass a structure by value in C++, you simply include the structure type as a function parameter. For example, if glitz is a structure variable of type MyStruct, you could pass it by value to a function called foo like this:

```cpp
void foo(MyStruct glitz) {
    // Function code here
}
```

To pass the address of a structure in C++, you can use a pointer to the structure type as a function parameter. For example, if glitz is a structure variable of type MyStruct, you could pass its address to a function called bar like this:

```cpp
void bar(MyStruct* pGlitz) {
    // Function code here
}
```

The trade-offs of the two approaches are as follows:

Passing a structure by value can be less efficient than passing its address, especially if the structure is large.
This is because passing by value requires the entire structure to be copied onto the stack,
which can be time-consuming if the structure contains a lot of data.

Passing a structure by value can be more convenient and safer than passing its address, especially if the structure is small and simple.
This is because passing by value ensures that the function cannot modify the original structure, which can be useful in certain situations where you want to avoid unintended modifications.

Passing the address of a structure can be more efficient than passing by value, especially if the structure is large.
This is because passing by address only requires a pointer to the structure to be copied onto the stack,
which is usually much faster than copying the entire structure.

Passing the address of a structure can be less convenient and less safe than passing by value,
especially if the structure is complex or if the function modifies the structure.
This is because passing by address allows the function to modify the original structure,
which can lead to unintended side effects or bugs if the function is not implemented correctly.

In general, the choice between passing a structure by value or by address depends on the size and complexity of the structure,
as well as the requirements of the function and the overall design of the program.
