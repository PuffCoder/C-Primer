# Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

In programming languages like C and C++, the following are the differences between the different data types:

```cpp
int, long, long long, and short: These are all integer data types. The differences between them lie in the size of the integer that can be stored in each data type.
int is usually 32 bits and can store integer values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
long is usually 64 bits and can store integer values ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
long long is also usually 64 bits and can store integer values ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
short is usually 16 bits and can store integer values ranging from -32,768 to 32,767.
Signed and unsigned types: Signed types can store both positive and negative numbers, while unsigned types can only store non-negative numbers. For example, int is a signed type, while unsigned int is an unsigned type.
float and double: These are both floating-point data types used to store decimal numbers. The main difference between them is the precision they can store.
float is a 32-bit floating-point data type and can store 7 decimal digits of precision.
double is a 64-bit floating-point data type and can store 15 decimal digits of precision.
In general, the choice of data type depends on the range and precision of values you need to store in your program. If you need to store large numbers, use a larger data type like long or long long. If you only need to store non-negative numbers, use an unsigned type. If you need to store decimal numbers with high precision, use double.
