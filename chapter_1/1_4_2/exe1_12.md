```cpp
 int sum = 0;
 for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i)
 sum += i;
```

### My answer:

The following for loop accumulated variable sum since -100 to 100.
the final value of sum is zero.

### after AI checked:

The following for loop accumulates the variable 'sum' from -100 to 100,
and the final value of 'sum' is zero.

### AI answer:

The following for loop accumulates the values of the variable 'sum'
by adding the integer value of 'i' in each iteration of loop.
The loop starts with 'i' being to -100,
and continues to execute as long as 'i' is less than or equal 100.
In each iteration, the value of 'i' is increamented by 1 using the pre-increment operator,
and the value of 'i' is added to the value of 'sum'.
The final value of 'sum' is zero, as the sum of integer from -100 to 100 is zero.
