// Exercise 1.15: Write programs that contain the common errors discussed in the box on page 16.
// Familiarize yourself with the messages the compiler generates.

1. Forgetting to include the required header files:

```cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

```

If you compile the above program without including the <iostream> header file, you will get an error message like this:

```cpp


main.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
main.cpp:4:2: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope
  cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
  ^~~~
main.cpp:4:2: note: suggested alternative: ‘cot’
  cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
  ^~~~
  cot
main.cpp:4:26: error: ‘endl’ was not declared in this scope
  cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
                          ^~~~
main.cpp:4:26: note: suggested alternative: ‘errno’
  cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
                          ^~~~
                          errno

```

The error message tells us that cout and endl were not declared in the current scope. The suggested alternative is not helpful in this case, because it's misspelled.

2. Forgetting to declare variables before using them:

```cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
  std::cin >> x >> y;
  std::cout << "The sum of " << x << " and " << y << " is " << x + y << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

If you compile the above program without declaring x and y, you will get an error message like this:

```cpp
main.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
main.cpp:4:12: error: ‘x’ was not declared in this scope
  cin >> x >> y;
            ^
main.cpp:4:16: error: ‘y’ was not declared in this scope
  cin >> x >> y;
                ^
```

The error message tells us that x and y were not declared in the current scope.

3. Using variables that have not been initialized:

```cpp


#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x;
  std::cout << "The value of x is " << x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

If you compile the above program, you will get a warning message like this:

```cpp
main.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
main.cpp:4:46: warning: ‘x’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
  cout << "The value of x is " << x << endl; ^
```

The warning message tells us that the variable x is being used without having been initialized

4. Dividing by zero:

```cpp


#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  int y = 0;
  std::cout << x / y << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

If you compile the above program, you will get an error message like this:

```cpp

main.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
main.cpp:5:17: error: integer division by zero [-Werror=div-by-zero]
  cout << x / y << endl;
                 ^
cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors
```

The error message tells us that we are trying to divide an integer by zero, which is not allowed.
