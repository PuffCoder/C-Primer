# return

- return 0 : A return value of 0 indicates success.
- return -1 : A nonzero return has a meaning that is defined by the system.

```cpp
echo $?
// print the program return value.
```

Compiler and execute exe1_2.cpp shows value 255 on this Mac.
Which is not behave as expected return -1.

### AI version:

When I compiled and executed 'exe1_2.cpp' on my Mac, it returned a value of 255, which is not the expected behavior.
It should have returned -1.
